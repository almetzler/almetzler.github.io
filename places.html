        Each year we try to go somewhere new. We try to have family discussions about where each of us want to go but 
        because of college and growing up we aren't all living together anymore. This can make vacation planning kind 
        of difficult. Now our vacation planning looks more like everyone sending random things to tht family groupchat 
        and then my parents putting together an itinerary that they think would work best for all of us.

            2020: Because of the pandemic we had to abandon our original plan of going to Peru to hike Machu Picchu 
            but because we still wanted to go somewhere as a family we decided to go to a lake house on Glen Lake in Glen Arbor, 
            Michigan. While we were up north we hiked Sleeping Bear Dune, learned to wake board, and got a little sunburnt.

            2019: We decided to go to Yellowstone so that we could hike and see the scenery on that part of the country. We got 
            the opportunity to watch Old Faithful go off from the patio of our lodge that we were staying at. We also went and looked 
            at all of the springs that had tons of pretty colors in them. For many of the hikes we had to wake up early so that by the 
            time we were on the trail and doing the hike it wasn't the middle of the day and we could complete the hike before it got 
            too hot and we became completely miserable.

            2018: This year we got to go to go on a 2 week safari in Tanzania. It was super cool to see all of the animals and our guide 
            was very knowledgeable about everything that we saw. Also, because of the company we went with we got to camp inside some of 
            of the parks so we were able to go see animals at sunrise and also we had the ability to get deeper into the park than those who
            were just staying in the hotels on the edges of the camp.
