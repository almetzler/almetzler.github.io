        Each year we try to go somewhere new. We try to have family discussions about where each of us want to go but 
        because of college and growing up we aren't all living together anymore. This can make vacation planning kind 
        of difficult. Now our vacation planning looks more like everyone sending random things to tht family groupchat 
        and then my parents putting together an itinerary that they think would work best for all of us.
