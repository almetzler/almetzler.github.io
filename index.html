	<h1>Metzler Family Vacations</h1>
</header>
<main>
<p>Every year my family goes on vacation to a new and different place. In these times of global pandemic I have decided to create a site dedicated
	to reliving all of the recent vacations we have been on.
</p>

<p>My previous jobs include Associate Professor at <a href = "https://www.cslub.edu/">California State University</a> and positions at NASA JPL, the Naval Research Lab, and the NSA. I received my BS from <a href = "https://www.kent.edu/">Kent State University Honors College</a> in Computer Science, and an MS and PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, also in Computer Science. My thesis was on Artificial Intelligence applications on the Nursebot Project, a robotic assistant for the elderly.</p>
