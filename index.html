			Every year my family goes on vacation to a new and different place. In these times of global pandemic I have decided to create a site dedicated
			to reliving all of the recent vacations we have been on.

			Our vacations typically last around two weeks and we try to alternate going to more nature-y places and more urban places. I typically prefer
			the city vacations because I'm not a huge fan of hiking and I get really bad pollen allergies which make spending a lot of time in the woods
			kind of unpleasent.
		</p>

			Some of our recent vacations include:
		</p>
			<ul class = 'vacation-list'>
				<li> Spending a week in Glen Arbor last summer so that we could get out of the house</li>
				<li> Going on a 2 week long safari trip in Tanzania</li>
				<li> Going to Alaska and seeing tons of interesting wildlife</li>
			</ul>
