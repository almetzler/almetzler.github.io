			Every year my family goes on vacation to a new and different place. In these times of global pandemic I have decided to create a site dedicated
			to reliving all of the recent vacations we have been on.

				Our vacations typically last around two weeks and we try to alternate going to more nature-y places and more urban places. I typically prefer
				the city vacations because I'm not a huge fan of hiking and I get really bad pollen allergies which make spending a lot of time in the woods
				kind of unpleasent.

				I generally try to ensure that if we don't go to a city, we at least go to a nature-y place that has cute animals that I can appriciate. Some of my family
				loves the hustle and bustle of big cities but some us would love to just hike for two weeks and then go back home. Generally we end up compromising on
				either going to a city and doing a lot of walking or going to a nature-y place that has options for those less fond of hiking.

				Some of our recent vacations include:

			<ul class = 'vacation-list'>
				<li> Spending a week in Glen Arbor last summer so that we could get out of the house</li>
				<li> Going on a 2 week long safari trip in Tanzania</li>
				<li> Going to Alaska and seeing tons of interesting wildlife</li>
			</ul>
