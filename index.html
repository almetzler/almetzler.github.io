		<p>
			Every year my family goes on vacation to a new and different place. In these times of global pandemic I have decided to create a site dedicated
			to reliving all of the recent vacations we have been on.
		</p>

		<p>
			My previous jobs include Associate Professor at <a href = "https://www.cslub.edu/">California State University</a> and positions at NASA JPL, the 
			Naval Research Lab, and the NSA. I received my BS from <a href = "https://www.kent.edu/">Kent State University Honors College</a> in Computer Science, 
			and an MS and PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, also in Computer Science. My thesis was on Artificial Intelligence applications on the Nursebot 
			Project, a robotic assistant for the elderly.
